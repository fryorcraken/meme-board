# Meme Board

A 4chan-style meme board where users can see, and upload memes.

It uses Waku and WebTorrent for full decentralization and censorship-resistance.

WebTorrent is used to upload and download the images, 
Waku is used to exchange the torrent data.

It is a singular file: [index.html](./index.html), allowing easy deployment, and re-deployment.
